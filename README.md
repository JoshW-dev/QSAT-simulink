# QSAT ADSC simulink 3D simulation

This is a temporary repo for the sat ADCS simulation.

## Simulation requirements

To run the simulation you will need MATLAB and Simulink installed on your computer:

https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html
https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html

As a queen's student, you should be able to get these for free. To access the 3D visualization you may need Simulink 3D Animation. Send me a message if you're interested in getting a liscense for it.

## Simulation Setup

Clone the repository and open the rotation.slx file with simulink. Running it will build the model and generate a folder called slprj. These are mostly small temporary files and should not be under source control.
